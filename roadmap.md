🎮 **Zombie Speed Game — Roadmap: From Day 1 to Launch Party**  🚀 (generated)

Welcome to the long, weird, and wonderful journey of building `Zombie Speed Game`. This roadmap is playful, big-hearted, and emoji-fuelled — for the team, the solo dev nights, and the people who will sprint through basements stabbing zombies at 120 BPM.

---

🟢 Day 1 — Spark & Sketch ✏️
- Kickoff: Make a short doc with the core idea (1 page). Draw a single map and the player's dream move. Quick decisions: control scheme, target platforms, and desired session length.
- Outcome: `design/one-pager.md`, a doodled map, and a playlist.

🟡 Week 1 — Rapid Prototyping 🛠️
- Prototype: Move, shoot, grapple hook, one enemy. No art — blocks and shapes only.
- Play: 5-minute sessions to test 
movement feel and one combat loop. Iterate until it feels fun.

🔵 Month 1 — Vertical Slice Weekend 🎯
- Build a tight vertical slice: full loop on one map with two enemy types, one powerup, basic HUD, and a simple wave mode.
- Outcome: playable demo for friends; use to gather reactions and tune pacing.

🔴 Month 2 — Systems & Tools 🔧
- Core systems: AI state machine, nav, spawn managers, loot/powerup system, save/load basics.
- Tools: simple JSON-driven level format and a small editor or level fixture loader.

🟣 Month 3 — Content Sprint 🌆
- Create 5 handcrafted maps (indoor + top world), enemy variants, and a basic progression loop (unlocking weapons/powerups).
- Start building music and SFX bank. Use placeholder tracks to tune tempo.

🟠 Month 4 — Modes & Procedural Arena 🌀
- Implement Speed, Sneak, Free fight and Survivor mode rules and scoring. Add procedural generation for arena mode.
- Implement seedable runs for reproducibility and leaderboards.

🟤 Month 5 — Feedback Loop & Iteration 🔁
- Run closed internal playtests; collect telemetry: run times, deaths, detection counts, deaths per enemy.
- Iterate difficulty curves, enemy behaviors, and player tuning. Add new FX/sounds to reinforce combat feel.

⚫ Month 6 — Polishing Phase ✨
- Lighting: flashlight mechanics, bonfire triggers, and atmospheric post-processing.
- Visual polish: better art, VFX, and final sprites for enemy types.

⚪ Month 7 — Accessibility & Controls ♿
- Add remappable inputs, gamepad presets, colorblind-friendly palettes, and UI scale options.
- Add options for slower game speed and assistance for players who want it.

🟩 Month 8 — Infrastructure & Leaderboards 🌐
- Implement saving of player equipment and top scores. Add optional online leaderboards and cloud save hooks.
- Add privacy/analytics opt-in and minimal telemetry for balance.

🟦 Month 9 — Beta & Community 💬
- Launch a closed beta to a small community. Run bug bashes, encourage video clips, and collect feedback on modes.
- Reward beta testers with in-game cosmetic or early unlocks.

🟨 Month 10 — Final Polish & Platform Prep 🏁
- Optimize performance, reduce load times, finalize build scripts, and prepare store assets.
- Finalize trailer, screenshots, and store descriptions.

🟥 Release Week — Ramp & Launch 🎉
- Final QA pass, marketing push, and scheduled launch day livestream. Coordinate with testers and community.
- Release on chosen platform(s) and monitor leaderboards and crash reports.

🏆 Release Day — Launch Party & Celebration 🎊
- Celebrate: a short livestream playing the game, community speedrun challenges, and giveaways.
- Postmortem doc: what worked, what to improve, and roadmap for post-launch content (events, skins, new maps).

🌟 Post-Launch — Live Support & Roadmap ✨
- Regular events (weekly challenge maps), seasonal content, balance patches, and community-driven features (map contests).
- Long-term: new enemy archetypes, co-op mode, and cross-platform leaderboards.

Notes & Fun Ideas:
- Speedrun crown: a glowing hat tracked on leaderboards.
- Flashlight challenges: levels where you only see a narrow cone — stealth + tense pacing.
- AI shadow companion: an optional bot that mimics your run for coaching or co-op.

If you'd like, I can:
- expand any month into a detailed task checklist, or
- convert this roadmap into a `project/roadmap.gsheet` CSV-style export, or
- commit the `roadmap.md` and open a PR with the change.
