# Zombie Speed Game (Generated)

A rough starter README for the `zombie_speed_game` project. This file is a short, editable overview intended to capture the project's intent, quick run notes, controls, and development pointers. Fill in engine-specific build/run steps and dependencies where indicated.

**Overview**

- **Project:**: Lightweight arcade-style survival game where the player navigates a map and evades or fights zombies.
- **Goal:**: Survive as long as possible, use speed/boost mechanics to outmaneuver enemies, and rack up a high score.

**Key Features (planned)**

- **Wave-based enemies:**: Increasing difficulty over time.
- **Speed/dash mechanic:**: Player has a short speed burst or stamina system.
- **Score and leaderboards:**: Track high scores locally (or remotely later).
- **Simple AI:**: Basic zombie pathfinding and homing behavior.

**Quick Start (developer)**

These are placeholder instructions — replace with concrete steps for your engine (Unity, Godot, Pygame, etc.).

- **Prerequisites:**: Install the engine/runtime you used to build the game (Godot).
- **Project files:**: See the repository root for source assets and `TODO.md` for planned work.


If this is a Unity project: open the folder in Unity Hub and run from the editor or build for your target platform.

**Controls (example)**

- **Move:**: `W/A/S/D` or arrow keys
- **Aim:**: Mouse or joystick
- **Dash / Speed boost:**: `Space` (short cooldown)
- **Pause / Menu:**: `Esc`

Adjust these to match the actual input mapping in the project.

**Development & Contributing**

- **Work in progress:**: This README is a starter. Use `TODO.md` to find tasks and project priorities.
- **Contributing:**: Fork, add a branch for your change, and open a pull request. Include screenshots and short notes for gameplay changes.
- **Testing:**: Add small reproducible steps for bugs and include expected vs actual behavior.

Notes:
- This is intentionally minimal. Replace placeholders with engine-specific setup and expand the Features and Controls sections once the implementation details are known.
