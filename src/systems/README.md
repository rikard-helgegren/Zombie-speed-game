# systems/
Shared systems used across multiple features.

## Examples:
- Combat → damage calculation, hit detection
- AI → State machine base classes
- Spawning → enemy or item spawners
- Save → game saving and loading

## Tips:
- Systems should be reusable and not tied to one feature.
- Keep state machine logic separate from actual entity scripts.
