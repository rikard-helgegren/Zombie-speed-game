Level scenes and scripts.

## Base Level (level_base):
- Shared logic for all levels
- Player spawning
- Camera setup
- HUD hookup
- Level start/end, win/lose conditions
- Zombie spawner hookup

## Specific Levels:
- TileMap and layout
- Props and decorations
- Unique spawn points and environmental hazards
- Level-specific events or cutscenes

## Tips:
- Keep level_base focused on rules of the game.
- Specific levels define content and layout only.
- Avoid hardcoding enemy AI or placement in base level.
