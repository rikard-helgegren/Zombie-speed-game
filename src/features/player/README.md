# player/
Contains all player-related logic.

## Typical Scripts:
- player.gd → movement, collision, animation
	-TODO: change to animated sprite
- player_input.gd → input mapping and handling
- player_health.gd → health, damage, death

## Tips:
- Keep movement and health separate for clarity.
- Input handling should be modular to allow AI control if needed.
